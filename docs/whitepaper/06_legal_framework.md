# 6. Legal Framework & Compliance

This section documents the legal architecture designed to protect the Platform under U.S. law while enabling global operation.

---

## 6.1 Merchant of Record Status

**ROLE:** Gap Junction acts as the **Merchant of Record** for all transactions.

### 6.1.1 Definition

As Merchant of Record, the Platform:
- Collects payment from Renters
- Holds funds in escrow
- Disburses earnings to Hosts
- Bears responsibility for chargebacks and disputes

### 6.1.2 Implications

| Aspect | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| Payment Processing | Platform (via Stripe) |
| Tax Withholding | Platform (1099-K for US hosts) |
| Customer Support | Platform (first line) |
| Refund Policy | Platform defined |
| Fraud Prevention | Platform implemented |

### 6.1.3 Aggregation Benefit

By aggregating 1,000+ micro-transactions into single payment events:
- Reduces per-transaction fees from ~$0.30 to ~$0.0003 per task
- Simplifies accounting and reconciliation
- Enables sub-cent compute pricing

---

## 6.2 Platform Neutrality (Safe Harbor)

**LEGAL DEFENSE:** Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (47 U.S.C. § 230)

### 6.2.1 Key Provisions

> "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."

### 6.2.2 Platform Position

Gap Junction maintains Safe Harbor protection by:

1. **No Content Inspection:** We do not inspect, review, or endorse the algorithmic payloads executed by Renters.
2. **Neutral Infrastructure:** The Platform is strictly infrastructure, not a content curator.
3. **User-Generated Content:** All Wasm modules are submitted by Renters; Platform does not create compute workloads.

### 6.2.3 Required ToS Language

```text
PLATFORM NEUTRALITY STATEMENT

The Gap Junction Platform acts strictly as infrastructure for 
distributed compute. We do not inspect, review, or endorse the 
algorithmic payloads or computational results generated by Renters.

The Platform makes no representations regarding the legality, 
functionality, or fitness of user-submitted workloads.

Users are solely responsible for ensuring their workloads comply 
with applicable laws and regulations.
```

---

## 6.3 Independent Contractor Classification

**LEGAL DEFENSE:** Host classification as independent contractors, not employees.

### 6.3.1 Classification Criteria (IRS 20-Factor Test)

| Factor | Gap Junction Implementation |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Control | Hosts set own hours, accept/reject tasks |
| Investment | Hosts provide own equipment |
| Profit/Loss | Hosts bear their own electricity costs |
| Permanency | No exclusive relationship required |
| Skill | No training provided by Platform |
| Integration | Hosts not integral to Platform's core service |

### 6.3.2 Required ToS Language

```text
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS

Hosts are independent contractors, not employees, agents, or 
partners of Gap Junction Inc. Hosts are solely responsible for:

1. Local, state, and federal tax reporting
2. Self-employment tax obligations
3. Business licensing (where applicable)
4. Compliance with local energy and zoning regulations

Gap Junction does not provide tax forms except as required by law 
(IRS Form 1099-K for US hosts earning $600+/year).
```

### 6.3.3 Operational Safeguards

To maintain IC status:
- No minimum hours required
- No exclusive contract
- Hosts can work for competitors
- Hosts set their own availability
- No performance reviews or quotas

## 6.4 Prohibited Use Policy

### 6.4.1 Strictly Banned Activities

The following activities are **strictly prohibited** and will result in immediate account termination:

| **Export-Controlled Technology** | ITAR/EAR violations |

### 6.4.2 Detection & Enforcement

While the Platform does not inspect workload content (Safe Harbor), we:
- Monitor for resource abuse patterns (crypto mining signatures)
- Respond to valid legal requests and DMCA takedowns
- Terminate accounts based on reports of prohibited use

## 6.5 Data Privacy & Ephemerality

### 6.5.1 Wasm Sandbox Ephemerality

**PRIVACY CLAIM:** Workloads are ephemeral; no user data is persisted.

```text
DATA EPHEMERALITY STATEMENT

Compute workloads execute within isolated WebAssembly sandboxes.
Upon task completion or termination:

1. All input data is immediately discarded
2. All output data is returned to the Renter and discarded
3. No intermediate state is persisted
4. Memory is zeroed before sandbox reuse

The Platform does not retain, analyze, or log workload inputs 
or outputs beyond the duration of task execution.
```

### 6.5.2 Financial Data Minimization

**SECURITY CLAIM:** Minimal financial data storage.

| Data Type | Stored? | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Credit Card Numbers | ❌ | Stripe tokenization |
| Bank Account Numbers | ❌ | Never collected |
| PayPal Email | ✅ | Only routing info stored |
| Transaction History | ✅ | For audit/compliance |

### 6.5.3 Required Privacy Policy Language

```text
FINANCIAL PRIVACY

Gap Junction does not store sensitive financial credentials:

• Credit card numbers are tokenized by Stripe
• Bank account numbers are NEVER collected
• Only PayPal email addresses are stored for payout routing

We handle financial data in compliance with PCI-DSS guidelines 
by minimizing data collection and utilizing certified payment 
processors.
```

## 6.6 Dispute Resolution

### 6.6.1 Chargeback Handling

As Merchant of Record, Gap Junction handles all chargebacks:

1. **Credit Disputes:** Renters may request refunds for unused credits
2. **Task Disputes:** Handled case-by-case based on execution logs
3. **Payout Disputes:** Investigated via PayPal resolution center

### 6.6.2 Arbitration Clause

```text
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any dispute arising from use of the Gap Junction Platform shall 
be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the 
American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial 
Arbitration Rules.

or class-wide arbitration.

Small claims court actions ($10,000 or less) may be brought 
in the jurisdiction of your residence.
```

## 6.7 Service Level Expectations

### 6.7.1 No Uptime Guarantee

**CRITICAL:** The Platform explicitly does NOT guarantee uptime.

```text
SERVICE AVAILABILITY

Gap Junction is a RESIDENTIAL compute grid, not a Tier-4 
datacenter. As such:

1. We make NO guarantee of uptime, availability, or latency
2. Nodes may go offline without notice
3. Tasks may fail and require resubmission
4. The Platform may be unavailable for maintenance

The Platform is provided "AS-IS" without warranty of any kind, 
express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of 
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

For mission-critical workloads, consider AWS, GCP, or Azure.
```

### 6.7.2 Best-Effort SLA

While no guarantees are made, the Platform targets:
- 95% task success rate
- <5 minute average task wait time
- <1 hour support response time
